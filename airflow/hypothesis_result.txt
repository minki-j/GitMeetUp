The repository contains a conversational AI system that uses natural language processing, knowledge retrieval, and language generation techniques to power a chatbot or virtual assistant. The system includes components for intent classification, question answering, and dialogue management, and is able to leverage both local and remote language models.
The repository contains a conversational AI system that follows a structured dialogue flow, with distinct stages for initiating the conversation, extracting relevant context, generating appropriate responses, and handling the end of the conversation. The system utilizes a combination of pre-defined rules, knowledge retrieval, and language generation powered by large language models (GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4) to enable the conversational experience.
The repository contains a conversational AI system that follows a modular, graph-based architecture to manage the dialogue flow. The system utilizes a combination of pre-defined rules, knowledge retrieval, and language generation powered by large language models (GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4) to enable the conversational experience.
The current hypothesis accurately describes the key aspects of the conversational AI system implemented in this repository. No major modifications are needed.
